        '''
        This implementation of parallelization with the multiprocessing module is sub-optimal, 
        compared to the use of Pools and the Pool.map function.  There are a few reasons for this 
        that were discovered over arduous trial and error.  First, parallelization in Python within 
        a class is difficult.  This is because the multiprocessing module uses cPickle under the 
        hood to serialize data as it slings things from one process to another.  cPickle cannot do 
        'instance' methods well at all.  This is the hack of using the __call__ function found on 
        StackOverflow.  Second, becuase OpenMDAO ultimately updates 'self' when given a new design 
        vector instead of passing arguments to a function, we cannot use map functions easily because 
        serialization of 'self' essentially freezes a snapshot of 'self'.  When using the map functions, 
        every return value was the one from default values, when 'self' was frozen.  So, we have to use 
        Process, which kicks off the execution as soon as self is updated.  This also means worse process 
        management than what a pool would offer though.
